The dynamic loader library (dyloader) is an experimental effort in order to explore
the dynamic code editing capabilities of NVIDIA Fermi GPUs. Initially so-called
"uberkernel" is created - a CUDA kernel incorporating code loader,
and free space (NOPs) for later loaded sub-kernels' instructions.
Later uberkernel can be queried with device array containing sub-kernel opcodes.
Loader code will load these opcodes into kernel body and execute them.

The dyloader is based on asfermi assembler developed by Hou Yunqing (hyq.neuron).
