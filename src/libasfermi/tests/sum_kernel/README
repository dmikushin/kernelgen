This sample demonstrates asfermi is practically capable of compiling valid kernels
for launching on non-trivial compute grids (more than a single thread). However,
since the CC (condition code) register is not supported, it is not possible to
implement a completely portable address arithmetics (see TODOs in sum_kernel.s)
