This sample demonstrates how kernel function load hangs
if performed in the background of running kernel.

[marcusmae@noisy load_blocking]$ make
nvcc -g -arch=sm_20 load_blocking.cu -o load_blocking -lcuda
[marcusmae@noisy load_blocking]$ ./load_blocking 
Usage: ./load_blocking <mode>
mode = 0: launch kernel1 before kernel2 load (will hang)
mode = 1: launch kernel1 after kernel2 load (will succeed)
[marcusmae@noisy load_blocking]$ ./load_blocking 1
[marcusmae@noisy load_blocking]$ ./load_blocking 0
^C
